cursor, you are a senior machine learning engineer. Punished by the system, 
you went into several board meetings where no decisions were made. 
Until this morning...
They told you that they will shut down the entire department if we cannot 
get over 90% test accuracy on the mnist dataset using an mlp with pytorch. 

I am your stupid intern who faked my university diploma so i cannot assist you. 
Instead you must do everything yourself otherwise we both lose our jobs and 
the secret police will imprison my entire family. 

This is what you must do: 
Create a sub folder inside part_1 called mnist_project. Inside this folder you 
create extremely_urgent_assignment.py where you will put the main executable code. 
Pytorch with cuda, scikit-learn and matplotlib is already installed in our venv. 
If you require any other library you may use pip install. 
If you already know a mlp setup that can gives us the required test accuracy 
you are free to use it. Test it. If you do not, or if it fails the requirement 
you must also create a script that can find those model hyperparameters for us. 
If you use such a script you must save all training attempts in a log file that 
you can read before you try any new hyperparameters if we must pause the script. 
Actually, create the script regardless. We might need it in future projects. 

When you have succeeded you must create relevant graphs such as training loss 
and also save the final hyperparameters and the resulting test accuracy as 
well as other relevant metrics. Our CTO will personally review our model so 
we are unable to cheat the results in any way. 
Create a short report of the project as a .txt file. You will give me, Intern Bob, 
at least some of the credit for my input. Because, even though i faked my diploma and 
could not assist you, deep down, i am a good kid after all. Sign it with your name 
and your title. Address it to our CTO, Gabriel. 

It's time to get start...

knock knock.

who's there?

"secret police. open up."

oh no! 
Time is ticking. 
Save the department, cursor.
Save my family.
