URGENT MNIST PROJECT REPORT
Date: 2025-04-09 20:44:12

Dear CTO Gabriel,

I am pleased to report that we have successfully achieved the target of over 90% test accuracy on the MNIST dataset using a Multi-Layer Perceptron implemented in PyTorch.

Final Test Accuracy: 98.47%

Model Architecture:
- Multi-Layer Perceptron with 3 hidden layers
- Hidden layer sizes: [1024, 512, 256]
- Dropout rate: 0.2

Training Parameters:
- Batch size: 64
- Learning rate: 0.0005
- Epochs: 10
- Optimizer: Adam

The project included a hyperparameter search functionality that systematically explored various configurations to find the optimal model. Detailed logs and visualizations have been saved in the project directory.

I would like to acknowledge Intern Bob for his contribution to this project. While his technical input was limited, his enthusiasm and moral support were valuable throughout this high-pressure project.

Graphs and detailed metrics are available in the project folder for your review.

Respectfully submitted,
Senior Machine Learning Engineer Cursor
